Document improvements:
  front page
  consistent margins
  fill in descriptions everywhere
  number of lines in listings!!
  a somewhat more appealing layout?
  separate section and listings chapter contents
  codelisting headers
  oversea TeX markup. especially, add \note!


Content improvements: (by chapter)


Test programs in document!

Contest
  Problem assessment sheet
  Checklist (as in algomanual "How to design algorithms")
  check kylix specific!
  c-lite?/script!

Datastructures
  STL and complex descriptions?
  Sign, rational, bigint descriptions
  BigInt!!
    unify bigint, more functionality in separate files,
    binops, move extra implementations to obsolete
  suffix tree
  kd tree, tries?

Number Theory
  Dynamic josephus
  More linalg.? matrix factorisation?
  Linear programming!!
  DFT?

Combinatorial
  generating: subsets, partitions, graphs ; calendrical ; job sched.
  numerical golden search
  root finding? (as in last contest)
  knapsack is here, to hard

Graph
  (algo manual har mst före s-p!)
  chinese postman?
  finding min cut edges?
  cost flows!!
  Planarity detection?
  more for_edge functional routines
  flow constructions: the actual constructions

Geometry
  a.dot(b) instead of dot(a, b)!
  Structure the interval and ccw stuff
  Triangulation?
  Range search?
  Point location?
  Polygon partitioning?
  Maintaining line arrangements?
  Some textbook geometry results!! (cross product? finding the xx point..)
  Sweeping pendulum! (from nwerc)

Pattern
  Longest common subsequence
  Shortest common superstring
  Pattern discovery .. ?

Game Theory!!!

Hard Problems
  Knapsack should be here
  satisfiability..?

In/out
  graph input away
  more paradigms?


Additions:

  Optimisation: linear programming
  Poker hands
  Simple algorithms!!
  Cryptography?

  (commented-out of lib.pdf:)
  Parsing (LALR/SLR?), Hard Problems (more heuristics!), Idioms!!,
  Calendrical, Time table

  Something on dynamic programming!! examples? general considerations?

  Extract useful methods and concepts from old problems!
  (browse old problem descriptions to find topics)


Testing!!
