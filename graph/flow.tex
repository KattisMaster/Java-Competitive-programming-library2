\problemtitle{Network Flow}

Flow graphs are directed graphs with flow capacities on their edges.

Many problems can be solved by finding the maximum flow (or, equivalently,
the minimal cut) of a flow graph.

The flow algorithms need quick access to the ``back edge'' of all egdes.
To accomodate for this, a special flow edge struct is used.
Flow graphs are constructed and updated by a couple of utility functions.
