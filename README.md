# tinyKACTL

This repo hosts the original KTH ACM team reference document.
It's not recommended for actual use -- among else, several algorithms
have known bugs -- but rather preserved for historical reasons.
Revision history goes back to 2002, and spans four different version
control systems (CVS -> BitKeeper -> CVS -> SVN -> git; not counting
Mercurial which was used for the newer KACTL).

The modern KACTL can be found [here](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl);
its `doc/historical/` directory contains a couple of rendered copies
of this repo from various points in time.
