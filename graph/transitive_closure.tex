\problemtitle{Transitive Closure}
The transitive closure, i.e. which nodes are connected, is found using
a sligthly modified Floyd-Warshall. The algorithm also gives a path between
two nodes, if they are connected.

\begin{algorithm}{Transitive Closure}
\reflisting{transitive closure}
\complexity{V^3}
\usage{ \sourceline{ transitive\_closure(adj, path,n); } }

The algorithm uses a bool adjacency matrix.
The adjacency matrix should contain
wheter there exists a path between {\tt a} and {\tt b} in {\tt adj[a][b]}.
The adjacency matrix is updated to contain whether {\tt a} and
{\tt b} are connected and {\tt path[a][b]} contains the from-node for a
path between {\tt a} and {\tt b}.
\end{algorithm}
