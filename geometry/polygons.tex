\begin{algorithm}{Inside polygon}
\reflisting{inside}

\desc
Determine whether a point is inside a polygon. If it is on an edge,
standard computer graphics rules determine the returned value (inside above
and to the left of the polygon, but not below or to the right).
This is usually \emph{not} the desired behaviour in contest geometry problems.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Winding number}
\reflisting{winding number}

\desc
Theta meta-angle winding number of a point.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Polygon area}
\reflisting{poly area}
\reflisting{poly area too}

\desc
The signed area of a polygon calculated by adding cross product or
trapezium areas.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Polyhedron volume}
\reflisting{poly volume}

\desc
The signed volume of a polyhedron calculated by adding vector tripple
product volumes.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Polygon cut}
\reflisting{poly cut}
\usage{\sourceline{%
iterator r\_end = poly\_cut(v.begin(), v.end(), p0, p1, r.begin())}}

\desc
Cuts a polygon with (a half plane specified by) a line.
{\tt r} is filled in with the cut polygon, and the end of the filled in
interval is returned. The polygon is kept connected by (overlapping)
line segments along the cutting line if the cut splits the polygon in parts.
\end{algorithm}


\begin{algorithm}{Center of mass}
\reflisting{center of mass}

\desc
Polygon and triangular center of mass.
\end{algorithm}
