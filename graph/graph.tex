\begin{algorithm}{Shortest Tour}
\desc
Shortest tour from A to B to A again not using any edge twice, in an
undirected graph: Convert the graph to a directed graph.  Take the
shortest path from A to B.  Remove the paths used from A to B, but
also negate the lengths of the reverse edges.  Take the shortest path
again from A to B, using an algorithm which can handle negative-weight
edges, such as Bellman-Ford. Note that there is no negative-weight
\emph{cycles}.  The shortest tour has the length of the two shortest
paths combined.

\begin{algorithm}{Kruskal}
\usage{ \sourceline{kruskal( graph, tree, n );} }
\complexity{ E\log E }
\desc
{\bf NB!} Requires {\texttt sets.cc}!
The resulting tree which is returned in {\tt tree} may
be the same variable as the graph.
