\begin{algorithm}{bigint full}
\complexity{}
\characteristics{Fully dynamic BigInt class which handles +,-,*,/ for
positive integers. Can output numbers in base-10 only. Division is simple and
does not use neither an iterative method, such as Newton-Raphson, nor FFT.
Has an iterative sqrt-function.}
