\begin{algorithm}{Flow constructions}
\keyword{Minimal cut} of a graph, generalization of edge connectivity. A
minimal cut is found by first finding a maximal flow. Then we consider the
set $A$ of all nodes that can be reached from the source using edges which
has capacity left (i.e. edges in the residue network). The edges between
$A$ and the complement of $A$ is a minimal cut.
\keyword{Minimal path cover} of a graph, determines a minimum set of paths to
cover it.
