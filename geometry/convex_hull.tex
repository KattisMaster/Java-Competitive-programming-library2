\problemtitle{Convex Hull}

\begin{algorithm}{Graham scan}
\reflisting{convex hull}
\complexity{n\log(n)}
\usage{{\tt convex\_hull(points p, idx, int n)}}

Fills the index vector {\tt idx} with indeces to the point vector {\tt p},
returning the number of points in the hull.
\characteristics{Does not handle colinear points on the hull consistently}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Graham scan, all hull points}
\reflisting{convex hull robust}
\complexity{n\log(n)}

Like {\tt convex\_hull}, but ensures all colinear hull points are included.
\characteristics{Perfect, but does not handle fewer than three points}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Three dimensional hull}
\complexity{n^2}
\reflisting{convex hull space}

\usage{{\tt convex\_hull\_space(points p, int n, list<ABC> \&trilist)}}

{\tt trilist} is a list of ABC-tripples of indices of vertices in the 3D
point vector {\tt p}.
\characteristics{Requires the hull to have positive volume. Arbitrarily
triangulates the surface of the hull.}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Point inside hull}
\reflisting{inside hull}
\complexity{\log(n)}
\usage{{\tt inside\_hull(hull p, int n, point t)}}

Determine whether a point {\tt t} lies inside the hull given by the
point vector {\tt p}.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Hull diameter}
\reflisting{hull diameter}
\complexity{n}
\usage{{\tt hull\_diameter2(hull p, int n, \&i1, \&i2)}}

Determine the points that are farthest apart in a hull.
{\tt i1, i2} will be the indices to those points after the call.
The squared distance is returned.
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Line-hull intersect}
\reflisting{line hull intersect}
\complexity{\log(n)}
\usage{
{\tt line\_hull\_intersect(hull p, int n, point p1, point p2, \&s1, \&s2)}}

Determine the intersection points of a hull with a line.
{\tt p1, p2, s1, s2} will be the intersection points and indices to the hull
line segments that intersect after the call. Returns whether there is an
intersection.
\end{algorithm}
