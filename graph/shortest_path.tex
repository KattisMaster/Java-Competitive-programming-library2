\begin{algorithm}{Bellman-Ford-2}
\reflisting{bellman ford 2}
\reflisting{distfun}
\complexity{VE}
\desc
Calculates the distance from a source to all other nodes.
Returns whether there is a negative distance cycle in the graph.
Instead of working with edge-lists as Bellman-Ford, the algorithm BF-2 uses
a single edge-list with pairs ((from,to), dist).
\end{algorithm}


\begin{algorithm}{Shortest Tour}
\desc
Shortest tour from A to B to A again not using any edge twice, in an
undirected graph:

Convert the graph to a directed graph.

Take the shortest path from A to B.

Remove the paths used from A to B, but also negate the lengths of the
reverse edges.

Take the shortest path again from A to B, using an algorithm which can handle
negative-weight edges, such as Bellman-Ford. Note that there is no
negative-weight \emph{cycles}.

The shortest tour has the length of the two shortest paths combined.
\end{algorithm}
