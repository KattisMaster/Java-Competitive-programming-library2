\begin{algorithm}{Flow constructions}
\keyword{Minimal cut} 
of a graph, generalization of edge connectivity. A minimal cut is
found by first finding a maximal flow. Then we consider the set $A$ of
all nodes that can be reached from the source using edges which has
capacity left (i.e. edges in the residue network). The edges between
$A$ and the complement of $A$ is a minimal cut.

\keyword{Minimal path cover} 
of a DAG, determines a minimum set of disjoint paths to cover all
vertices.  For each $i \in V$, create two new vertices $x_i$ and $y_i$
and draw an edge between $x_i$ and $y_j$ if $(i,j) \in E$.  Find a
maximal bipartite matching, and if $(x_i, y_j)$ is in the matching,
let the edge $(i,j)$ be part of a path.
