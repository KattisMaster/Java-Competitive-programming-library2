\begin{algorithm}{mulmod}
\reflisting{mulmod}
\characteristics{{\tt mulmod} calculates $ab\mbox{ mod } n$ in a way that
allows numbers as large as MAXINT/2 to be used (which would otherwise give
an overflow).}
\usage{ \sourceline{ mulmod(5678945893454353ULL, 2423948234343ULL,
	31231231231231231ULL) == 14355903581119892; } }

\begin{algorithm}{Bigint Simple}
\reflisting{bigint simple}
\characteristics{Fully dynamic BigInt class which handles +,-,* for
positive integers. Can output numbers in base-10 only. This is a stripped
down version of {\tt bigint full}.}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Bigint Full}
\reflisting{bigint full}
\characteristics{Fully dynamic BigInt class which handles +,-,*,/ for
positive integers. Can output numbers in base-10 only. Division/modulus is
simple and does not use neither an iterative method, such as Newton-Raphson,
nor FFT. Has an iterative sqrt-function.}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}{Bigint Per}
\reflisting{bigint per}
\characteristics{Dynamic BigInt class which handles +,*. Additionally
it can do divison/modulus with integers, find the n:th root of a number and
do exponentiation with \^~. NB! no subtraction.}
